# Blue_light_efficiency
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of blue light emergency systems and their impact on crime incidents, focusing on the period from 2016 to 2018. The primary goal is to understand how these systems influence crime rates and patterns in their vicinity during a stable and relatively recent time frame, free from major social upheavals or policy changes.
